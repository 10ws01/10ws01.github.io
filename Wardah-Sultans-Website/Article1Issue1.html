            <h4>Appleton City Council Announces Annual Appleton City Fair Date</h4>
            <footer><b>Jan 3rd, 2032  by Wardah Sultan</b></footer>
            <p>As we Appletonians know, each year, we celebrate our town by holding a city fair over one summer weekend. Additionally, every year the chosen weekend changes, allowing the fair to incorporate different activities, acts and stations every year. On January 2nd, the Appleton City Council announced the date of this celebration.</p>
            <p>Typically, the fair takes place sometime in August, but this year, various other events taking place have caused the need for the fair to take place earlier. For this reason, the fair's date has been set as <i>July 15th -17th, 2032</i>. </p>
            <p> The festival is to include tasteful music, a diverse selection of foods from all the best caterers, and activities for people of all ages. We hope to see you there!</p>
